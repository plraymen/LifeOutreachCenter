            <p>
                An unplanned pregnancy can be deeply unsettling.  Our compassionate team works to create a safe and confidential place for you to be supported as you consider your pregnancy options.  You deserve to know the facts, and to have the necessary resources to make an informed choice.  We care. 
                <br>

                Serving women and families of the Copper Country since 1981, the Life Outreach Centers are now launching medical services.  Limited ultrasounds are provided under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician to confirm pregnancy.  For more information, please <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> our Hancock office.
